                               INTRODUCTION.
To the Teachers :
     It is the writer's wish that these primers show forth the following :
     1.      That a primer may be based upon the classic .
     2. That a primer may be constructed with reference to
             (a) Action,*
             (6) Imitation ,
             (c) Fun,
which , as every sympathetic observer of children must know, are the
elements that enter most largely into the stories which little children
like best.

    As to the classic basis , certainly a vocabulary may be evolved as well
from “ The Three Bears,” for example, as from cats and dogs. For can
not a child as well in the beginning say, I see a bear as I see a cat ?
And can he not build up day by day from the bear as well as from the cat ?
     Then, too, these tales are pedagogical to the primer grade .         Every
first grade or kindergarten teacher knows the delight with which littie
children listen as she reads them ; hence that first of all elements — interest
  - is fully satisfied in these tales.
     Again we find in these classic tales a second pedagogical principle —
that of action ; for in these olden tales most rapid and vigorous activity
predominate.
       A third principle, too , is in evidence — that of repetition ; and a child
loves the rhythm of repetition .
       And still a fourth pedagogical quality is found in these classic tales ,
1. e. , the dramatic - personification – dialogue - or in another term ,
     * See Barnes' “ Studies in Education ,” Vol. I.

imitation :: Every teacher knowshow little children love to personify ; to
put words into the mouths of animals ; to fancy conversations between
the flowers and the trees, and to build dialogue from the verse and from
the story .
     There is, however, yet another element which should come into child's
literature and which is found in perfection in these old classics ; and that
is the element of the serial.

     Most primers are now carrying something akin to a continued story,
but a true serial is one that represents different ages of one act. For
example, in the famous German picture book , " Slovenly Peter ,” we have
in perfect serial story, the tale of a heedless boy's mishaps at home and
at school.
     The “ Slovenly Peter " of which I speak is a book of serial
pictures ; funny, the children call them, and no picture book has ever been
so popular in all Europe.       Moreover, it has been translated into other
languages for the children of other lands.
    The Sunday newspaper, with its Katzenjammers, its Foxy Grandpa,
and its Buster Brown, is showing us a lesson in pedagogy which it
would be well for us as teachers to heed. These serial pictures are
the Sunday delight of millions of little children and glad would the
teacher be if, on Monday morning, she could arouse one-half the eager
ness and interest in the primer reading lesson . It would look then as if,
while we are instructing our children through our primers, they are getting
their education through the Sunday papers .
     The element of the grotesque, too, which enters so largely into
these Sunday serial pictures, is one very dear to the child's heart, and is
found again in these old classics ; and we cannot afford to ignore that
element in the construction of our primary reading books.
     It was once my pleasure to look over several hundreds of papers
written by school children in reply to the question, What is the funniest
                                      5

thing that you can remember ? In the papers from the upper grades there
were, of course , the elements of adult wit ; but in the papers of the
little children was found an almost universal testimony to the truth that
the grotesque is the principal element in a child's idea of " funny."
Little girls in long dresses, little boys in big hats, topsy turvy con
ditions ; and , above all, deeds of monkeys were predominant.
      It has been suggested that, possibly, in putting these classic tales
into a primer form , from which the child shall perform the labor of
learning to read, we may take from the child his enjoyment of the
classic .
      If reading were taught in the old -fashioned , laborious way, this
question would indeed be worthy of grave consideration ; for to rob a
child of joy in these classic tales would indeed be unfortunate and unwise.
The manuscript of these primers was, therefore, given over to a primary
teacher who made an honest test of them upon the children . This teacher
reported in favor of the experiment, it being her opinion that since there
is so little labor and so much play connected with the modern reading
process, the child's interest was by no means deadened ; rather was it
heightened and the ambition stirred by the presence of reading material
with which they were already familiar. That this should have been so
seems probable and consistent when we recall that children love always to
do things with which they are familiar.
     Such being true, then, why may we not throw off primer traditions of
passivity and colorless ethics and give to the first grades as well as to the
third and those above, the kind of reading that they love ; and that
which is in harmony with the child's real interest.

              CONSTRUCTION WORDS.

     There is a certain list of words the mastery of which
is absolutely essential to the child before he can acquire
any ease or comfort in reading.
     This list is no less essential to the compiler of a primer
if the compiler would present thoughts that are sequential
and reasonable.
    It should, then , be the aim of any teacher who
thinks of the child as a human being rather than as a first
grade pupil, to see that this list is acquired as soon as
possible.
