Where is she?"
The wolf looked up the hill.
The wolf looked down the hill.
The wolf looked up at the trees.
But he did not look into the barrel.
O, you silly wolf!
"O! O! What if he should see me!" said the pig.

"Please go and find food," said Mother Pig.
"Please go and build a house."
"I will go," said the first pig.
I will go," said the second pig.
I will go," said the third pig.
So the first little pig went out.
He met a man.
The man had straw.
"Please give me some straw."
"Poor little pig!" said the man.
"You shall have some straw.
But a straw house is not strong."
"O yes, it is," said the silly pig.
So the first little pig built a straw house.
By and by a wolf came.
"Little pig, little pig, let me in," said the wolf.
"No, no! I swear to you no!" said the pig.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff.
And I'll blow your house in."
So the wolf huffed and he puffed.
And he blew the house in.
"O! O! O!" said the pig.
"Ha! ha!" said the wolf.
"Now I shall eat you."
So the wolf ate the first little pig.
Silly, silly little pig!
Then the second pig went out.
He, too, met a man.
The man had wood.
"Please give me some wood," said the second little pig.
"Poor little pig!" said the man.
"You shall have some wood.
But a wood house is not strong."
"O yes, it is," said the second little pig.
"Silly little pig!" said the man.
So the second little pig built a wood house.
By and by the wolf came.
"How do you do?" said the wolf.
"Please let me come in."
"O, no," said the little pig.
"I can not let you come in."

"Little pig, little pig, let me in," said the wolf.
"No, no! You bad wolf! I swear to you no!" said the pig.

"Then I'll huff," said the wolf.
"And I'll puff," said the wolf.

"Now I shall eat you."
So the wolf ate the second little Pig
Silly, silly little pig.
Then the third little pig went out.
He, too, met a man.
This man had bricks.
"Please give me some bricks?" said the third little pig.
"I must build a house."
"Poor little pig," said the man.
"You shall have some bricks.
Bricks will build a strong house."
"Thank you," said the third little pig.
"I wish to build a strong house."
So the third little pig built a house.
It was a strong brick house.
Then the wolf went to the third little pig.
"Little pig, little pig! Let me in!" said the wolf.
"No, no! You bad wolf! I swear to you no!" said the pig.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff.
And I'll blow your house in."
So he huffed and he puffed.
He could not blow the house in.
The house was of brick.
The house was strong.
The wolf was angry.
He went away to think.
"What shall I do?" he said.
"I can not blow down the house.
But I must have the pig.
I must think out a way to get the third little pig," said the wolf.
One day he went to the house.
"How do you do, little pig?" he said.
"How do you do?" said the pig.
"I know a turnip field," said the wolf.
"Do you like turnips?"
"O yes, I like turnips."
"Will you go with me to the turnip field?"
"O yes, I will go.
When will you come for me?"
"I will come at six."
At six the wolf came.
"Are you ready, little pig?"
Yes, I am ready."
Then let me in."
"But I have three turnips," said the pig.
"Where did you get the turnips?"
"I went to the field."
"When did you go?"
"I went at five."
The wolf was angry.
He went away.
"I must think out a new way," he said.
So he went away to think.
One day he came again.
"How do you do, little pig?" said the wolf.
"I know a pear tree.
Do you like pears?"
"Yes, I like pears."
"Let us go and get some pears," said the wolf.
"Yes," said the little pig.
"I will come for you at five."
At five the wolf came.
The little pig was not in her house.
The wolf ran to the pear tree.
There she was.
Now I shall eat her," said the wolf.
"How do you do?" said the little pig.
"Do you like pears, wolf?
See, here is a good pear."
So she threw the pear to the wolf.
She threw it across the field.
The wolf ran for it.
"Now I must get down," said she.
"Now I must run."
So the little pig came down from the tree.
She ran and ran.
The wolf saw her
So he ran and ran.
Run, little pig, run!
She reached her house.
She ran into the house.
How angry the wolf was!
"I must think out a new way to catch that pig," he said.
So he went away to think.
One day he came again.
"Let us go to the circus," said he.
"O yes," said the little pig.
"I like to go to the circus."
"I will come for you at four," said the wolf.
At four the wolf came.
The little pig was not in her house.
"So she is at the circus," he said.
"I will catch her there.
The wicked pig!"
So the wolf went to the circus.
Yes, there was the pig.
"O! O! O! What shall I do?" cried the pig.
"There is the wolf.
He will see me.
I will run up the hill."
So the pig ran up the hill.
"O, there you are," said the wolf.
Run, pig, run!
She ran up the hill.
The wolf ran up the hill, too.
"O, will he catch me?"
"Yes, I will catch you."
There was a barrel on the hill.
The pig ran into it.
The wolf did not see her go in.
"Where is that pig?" said the wolf.
He looked up the hill.
He looked down the hill.
He could not see her.
Then the barrel began to roll.
"What is that?" said the wolf.
And the wolf ran.
He ran down the hill.
The barrel rolled down the hill.
The wolf ran faster.
The barrel rolled faster.
Then the wolf ran home.
He did not know that the pig was in the barrel.
One day the wolf came again.
He came to the little brick house.
"I shall eat you this time.
I shall catch you.
I shall come down the chimney."
"O! O!" said the pig.
"What shall I do?
I shall build a fire.
I shall burn the wolf."
So the wolf climbed into the chimney.
"O, now I have you," he said.
But see! See!
He is caught in the chimney.
He cannot get out.
He cannot get down.
"Ow! ow! ow!"
Then the pig made more fire.
The pig laughed to herself.
"Now I shall cook you.
Now I shall eat you.
You will make a good dinner."
So the wicked wolf was cooked.
He caught the first little pig.
He caught the second little pig.
He ate the first little pig.
He ate the second little pig.
But he could not catch this little pig.
He could not eat her.
The little pig caught the wicked wolf.
The little pig ate the wicked wolf.
Mother Pig had a good dinner.
The little pig had a good dinner.
Such a good dinner!
O, such a good dinner!
