                           INTRODUCTION.
To the Teachers :

    It is the writer's wish that these primers show forth the following :
    1.   That a primer may be based upon the classic.
    2.   That a primer may be constructed with reference to

         (a) Action, *
         (b) Imitation ,
         (c) Fun,

which, as every sympathetic observer of children must know, are the
elements that    enter most largely into the stories which little children
like best.
    As to the classic basis, certainly a vocabulary may be evolved as well
from " The Three Bears , " for example, as from cats and dogs .        For can-
not a child as well in the beginning say, I see a bear as I see a cat?
And can he not build up day by day from the bear as well as from the cat ?
    Then, too, these tales are pedagogical to the primer grade . Every
first grade or kindergarten teacher knows the delight with which littie
children listen as she reads them ; hence that first of all elements- interest
   is fully satisfied in these tales .
     Again we find in these classic tales a second pedagogical principle —
that of action ; for in these olden tales most rapid and vigorous activity
predominate.
     A third principle, too, is in evidence      that of repetition ; and a child
loves the rhythm of repetition .
     And still a fourth pedagogical quality is found in these classic tales ,
i. e., the dramatic — personification — dialogue — or in another term,
    • See Barnes' " Studies in Education ," Vol. I.
                                         3

imitation .   Every teacher knows how little children love to personify ; to
put words into the mouths of animals ; to fancy conversations between
the flowers and the trees, and to build dialogue from the verse and from
the story.
     There is , however, yet another element which should come into child's
literature and which is found in perfection in these old classics ; and that
is the element of the serial.

     Most primers are now carrying something akin to a continued story ,
but a true serial is one that represents different ages of one act. For

example, in the famous German picture book, " Slovenly Peter," we have
in perfect serial story, the tale of a heedless boy's mishaps at home and
at school.
     The " Slovenly Peter " of which          I speak is a book of serial

pictures ; funny, the children call them, and no picture book has ever been
so popular in all Europe .      Moreover, it has been translated into other
languages for the children of other lands .
     The Sunday newspaper, with its Katzenjammers , its Foxy Grandpa,
and its Buster Brown , is showing us a lesson in pedagogy which it
would be well for us as teachers to heed .         These serial pictures are
the Sunday delight of millions of little children and glad would the
teacher be if, on Monday morning, she could arouse one-half the eager-
ness and interest in the primer reading lesson .   It would look then as if,
while we are instructing our children through our primers, they are getting
their education through the Sunday papers .

     The element of the grotesque, too, which enters so largely into
these Sunday serial pictures, is one very dear to the child's heart, and is
found again in these old classics ; and we cannot afford to ignore that
element in the construction of our primary reading books .
     It was once my pleasure to look over several hundreds of papers
written by school children in reply to the question, What is the funniest
                                      5


thing that you can remember ? In the papers from the upper grades there
were, of course, the elements of adult wit ; but in the papers of the
little children was found an almost universal testimony to the truth that
the grotesque is the principal element in a child's idea of " funny. "
Little girls in long dresses , little boys in big hats, topsy turvy con-
ditions ; and , above all, deeds of monkeys were predominant.
      It has been suggested that, possibly, in putting these classic tales
into a primer form , from which the child shall perform the labor of
learning to read, we may take from the child his enjoyment of the
classic .

      If reading were taught in the old-fashioned , laborious way, this
question would indeed be worthy of grave consideration ; for to rob a
child of joy in these classic tales would indeed be unfortunate and unwise.
The manuscript of these primers was, therefore , given over to a primary
teacher who made an honest test of them upon the children .     This teacher
reported in favor of the experiment, it being her opinion that since there
is so little labor and so much play connected with the modern reading
process , the child's interest was by no means deadened ; rather was it
heightened and the ambition stirred by the presence of reading material
with which they were already familiar. That this should have been so
seems probable and consistent when we recall that children love always to
do things with which they are familiar .
     Such being true , then, why may we not throw off primer traditions of
passivity and colorless ethics and give to the first grades as well as to the
third and those above , the kind of reading that they love ; and that
which is in harmony with the child's real interest.

                 CONSTRUCTION                  WORDS.


       There is a certain list of words the mastery of which

is absolutely essential to the child before he can acquire
any ease or comfort in reading.
       This list is no less essential to the compiler of a primer

if the compiler would present thoughts that are sequential
and reasonable.

       It   should,    then,   be the    aim   of   any   teacher who
thinks of the child as a human being rather than as a first
grade pupil, to see that this list is acquired as soon as
possible.

  Why are you here ? ”


  "I came to eat you , grandmother. "


  "Help !   help ! "    cried   the   grand-


mother.


  The wood choppers did not             hear.


  "Help !   help ! "


  But no help came.


  Poor grandmother !


  No help came to her.


  The wood     choppers      were     too   far


away .


  Soon there was no         grandmother.


  There was only a wolf.


  And he was a bad, bad wolf !


  O , what a bad wolf !

The bad wolf put on a cap .


The bad wolf put on glasses .


It was grandmother's cap .


They were grandmother's glasses .


"Now I must get into bed ," he said .

  "Little   Red    Riding        Hood     will


soon be here .


  I shall eat her, too ."


  So he got into bed .


  "I   shall     wait      for   Little   Red


Riding Hood .


  She will come soon. "


  O, you bad wolf !

                     69


  "The voice is soft, " said the kids .


  “ Is it the wolf again ?


  Or is it our Mother Goat ? "


  "Let me in , " said the wolf.


  "Why do you not open the door ? "


  "Can   it   be   the    wolf ? "   said   one


kid .


  " His voice is so soft, " said another.


  The    kids   kept      very   still   for   a


time .


  They did not open the door.


  "Don't you hear me ? " called the


wolf again .


  "Don't you hear your mother ?


  Why do you not let me in ? ”

  The kids ran to the window.


  "Let us see your feet, " they         said .


  "Open the door," said the wolf .


  "No , no !


  Not   until   you    let   us   see   your

feet," said the kids .
                     71


  "Let us see your feet, I say, " cried


the oldest kid .


  " O , we see them .


  Your feet are black .


  Mother Goat's feet are white .


  So go away .


  You are the wolf.


  We will not let you in.


  We    will   not   open   the   door   for


you .


  You are not our Mother Goat.


  You are a wicked old wolf.



  We know your black feet.


  We know you , wolf.


  So away with you ! ”
                         72


                        IX


  So the wolf went away again.


  “ Those       kids    are    very   wise , "   he


said .


  "I     will   go to   the miller and           get


some flour .



  I will put it on my feet. ”


  So the wolf put             flour on his feet.


  Then the wolf          went to the house


again .


  " Let me in , dear little kids, ” said


the wolf.


  "I am Mother Goat.


  I have food for you .


  So open the door .
                     73



   Quick, little kids , for      I    am very


tired . "


  " O no ,   we   will    not   let   you   in , "


said the kids .


   " You must     first   let   us    see   your


feet ."


  "Well , look at my feet," said             the


wolf.


  The kids looked .


  Yes , the feet were white .


  The voice was soft, too .


  "The voice is soft, " said          one   kid .


  "The feet are white , " said another.


   'It must be Mother Goat.


  Yes, we will open the door . "
                     74

  So the kids opened the door.


  In ran the wolf.


  "O!   O!   O !" said the kids .


  For   they   saw   that they      had   let

in the wolf.
                       75


  The kids ran and screamed .


  The wolf ran and growled .


  "O !   O!   O !


  O Mother Goat, come ! " cried    the


kids .


  " O come, come , Mother Goat !


  Help , help your baby kids ! "


  "You need not cry for help ," said


the wolf .


  " Mother Goat cannot help you .


  She has gone away .


  I shall now have a good dinner.


  One, two, three !


  Four, five , six !

  The Mother Goat cried .


  "Did      you   let   the wolf     in ? ” said

the goat .


  "Yes ,     we   let   the   wolf   in ,"   said

the kid .


  "He had a soft voice .

  He had white feet.

for us .


  The      wolf   said    that   he   was   the


Mother Goat.


  He told us to open the door.


  We thought it was you.


  So we let the wolf in.


  Then he ate the kids .


  I hid in the clock . "


  " O , my kids ! ” cried the goat.

  By and by , the goat and   the one


kid went out for a walk .


 The goat saw the wolf near a tree.


  He was asleep .


 "There is the wolf !" said the kid .
                      83


  "The wicked wolf ! " said the goat.


  He has eaten my kids .


  Some      way   I   must   get   my     kids


again . "


  The goat went back to her house.


  She opened the door and went in .


  She   took   her     scissors    from   the


work basket .


  Then she went        back to the      wolf.


  The wolf was still asleep .


  "Now, I will get my kids again ,"


said the goat .


  "Sh ! don't wake the wolf.


  See, I have my scissors .

  Then the goat got six large stones .


  She   put   the   stones          inside   the


wolf.


  Then she sewed the wolf up again .


  The wolf slept on and on .

  " You were a bad wolf to eat              my


kids , " said the goat.

pocket .


  "Good-bye, bad wolf," she said .


  Then she went home.

  He could not walk very well .


  "Why,      how       heavy   I    am!"   said


the wolf.

  He dragged       himself down to the


spring.

  He tried to drink.


  But     he   fell   head   first   into the

cried the wolf.


  " O no ," said the goat.


  " I will not help you out.

for you .



  My kids let you in.
